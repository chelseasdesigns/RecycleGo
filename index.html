                    it's a practice that is being praised nationwide, and while most people know what the basic idea of recycling is,
                    a lot of people don't know what counts as correct recycling. RecycleGO is made to not only educate people on what proper recycling is 
                    within their communities and homes but also encourage those people to practice recycling habits in their daily lives.</p>

                <p>Recycling is a sustainable lifestyle that can decrease the amount of waste we produce. As humans, we already produce <a href="https://www.titlemax.com/discovery-center/lifestyle/trash-one-person-produces-year/#:~:text=How%20Much%20Garbage%20Do%20Humans,pounds%20of%20trash%20per%20year.">almost 2.6 trillion pounds of trash per year</a>.
                With recycling, we can decrease that number, as well as reducing the amount of energy, water, and air pollution that are produced. And lastly, it's much safer for the enviornment
                by elimated the amount of plastic and carbon waste that end up in the ecosystems of wildlife.</p>
